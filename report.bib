abstract = {We present a new method of calibrating adaptive optics systems that greatly reduces the required calibration time or, equivalently, improves the signal-to-noise ratio. The method uses an optimized actuation scheme with Hadamard patterns and does not scale with the number of actuators for a given noise level in the wave-front sensor channels. It is therefore highly desirable for high-order systems and/or adaptive secondary systems on a telescope without a Gregorian focal plane. In the latter case, the measurement noise is increased by the effects of the turbulent atmosphere when one is calibrating on a natural guide star.},

    abstract = {If Earth-like planets orbit nearby stars, they could be detectable with specially designed telescopes. Direct observations would be very revealing, particularly low resolution infrared spectra, which could establish habitability on the basis of temperature and atmospheric water. Abundant, primitive life based on organized molecular structure might reveal itself, as on Earth, by an atmospheric composition modified in ways unlikely to be from inorganic processes. The technical challenge is to detect and obtain spectra of an object with Mbol ∼ 28 that is very close to a star and some 5 × 109 times less luminous. Indirect methods, used to detect Jupiter-mass planets, do not seem to offer an easy intermediate step to finding Earth-like planets. However, the direct detection techniques needed for spectroscopy also offer a viable method for discovery by imaging. Thermal infrared wavelengths, in which a planet emits most energy, are the most favorable. A robust search for planets of ∼100 nearby solar-type stars, with spectroscopic follow-up of Earth-like candidates, could be made with an interferometer ∼75 m in length. In visible light, the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) could, with the addition of a high resolution correction instrument, see Earth-like planets around a dozen or so of the nearest stars. Both infrared and optical instruments are possible within the range of current space agency plans. }

	abstract = {Methods. We implemented EFC+LDFC on the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument using its internal light source (off-sky). We first deployed the implicit EFC (iEFC) algorithm to generate the dark hole with a classical Lyot coronagraph (CLC) with a 114 mas diameter focal-plane mask at 1550 nm wavelength. This iEFC algorithm was deployed with pairwise probes. Using iEFC with pair-wise probes, we directly measured the response matrix of the deformable mirror (DM) modes and built the control matrix by inverting the response matrix. After the calibration process, we generated the dark hole by closing the iEFC loop. When the dark hole was generated, we implemented spatial LDFC to restore and maintain the contrast of the dark hole. In the tests shown here, we introduced static and quasi-static speckles, and then we operated spatial LDFC in closed loop to verify its performance. We used numerical simulations to derive linearity range and photon-noise-limited dynamical performance.
Results. Using iEFC, we generated the dark hole with a ∼2×10−7 contrast in a narrow-band filter (λ = 1550 ± 25 nm). We reached a contrast floor limited by the camera noise. Comparison between pre- and post-iEFC images shows that with iEFC in closed-loop operation, an improvement in contrast of a factor ≈100–500× was reached across the dark hole. In the spatial LDFC experiments, we were able to nearly fully remove the speckles generated by the DM perturbation and maintain the contrast of the dark hole.
Conclusions. This work presents the first laboratory demonstration of combining two FPWFS\&C methods, iEFC and spatial LDFC. Linear range and photon-noise-limited sensitivity are provided to derive close-loop performance for on-sky systems. Our results provide a promising approach for taking advantages of both high contrast and a 100\% science duty cycle for HCI systems.},
